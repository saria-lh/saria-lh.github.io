# About
I am an AI/ML Research Engineer with a background in Telecommunications. I spent a year and a half working for Samsung Research America, AI Center in Montreal, engaging in a variety of projects related to wireless communications, indoor human-state estimation and localization, home automation, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Prior to my time at Samsung, I completed my M.Sc. in Computing at Queen's University in 2021. My Master's thesis focused on the development of distributed algorithms for Federated Learning and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Before doing my Masters, I worked as a full-time Research Assistant at Qatar University for two years, where I mainly worked developing Reinforcement Learning for wireless communication systems.
